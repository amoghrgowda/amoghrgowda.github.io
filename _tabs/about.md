Oh? you want to know the "about"? About me or about this website? Let's discuss both. 
### About 'Me':
- Computer science engineering student (kind of a noob but improving).
- Studied in an average, "tier 3" college, if you will.
- Definitely a pure hearted person and an innocent soul. Yes, No doubt in that haha..
- I enjoy my alone time (especially in the night), where I can learn about computers and cars (or sleep) plus isn't it just so peaceful to be alone?
- My favorite sport? What's a sport? never heard (* sad and unhealthy noises *).
- Into philosophy, spirituality and meta-physical reality. (**Note**: I said spirituality, get your religion outta here)
- My favorite food gotta be anything Indian and healthy (There's nothing better).
- No, I don't watch Anime or Movies anymore. I lost interest in them and I don't know why :(
- My favorite music genre is Lo-Fi and phonk.
- Goals are cars, bikes, cool coding skills to flex, a successful company of my own representing my blood, sweat and tears, and big houses with dedicated gaming rooms set up. 


Okay...enough yapping about me, find more out by reading through my blogs (after all, I didn't set this website up for nothing) haha..


### About the blog:

You need to keep a few things in mind~
1. The blog will be kept pretty informal and messy (like a blog should be. I guess?).
2. I'm not a native English speaker so let's not judge my grammar and all that, cool?
3. This blog will contain mainly 3 categories as of now - programming, life and random.
    - 'Programming' will act as a documentary for everything new I learn about programming. It is supposed to help me keep track of what I've learned and how far I have come since I started blogging. Think of it as a progress check, if that helps you understand better.
    - 'Life' will be about me blogging about the new experiences such as traveling or when I decided to try something new or a new path that I decided to take in my life or just anything significant that happens in my life.
    - 'Random' will be me talking about, well...random stuff with little to no importance. It will be full of my personal opinions, me crying and complaining about something for 2 million paragraphs or using the blog as a means to take out the 'hidden' emotions such as anger, frustration, motivation, sadness and so forth.
4. It might contain a lot of errors because I won't proof-read everything, I have limited time in a day, come on now, I can't be spending more than a couple minutes writing this blog everyday. Just use the brain and put things together for me, thanks <3
5. This is my first ever blog/diary so feel free to give me any suggestions and feedback if you can. I'd appreciate it a lot, thanks!
